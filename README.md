# Understanding of Basics of Neural Networks

This small project is all about understanding some of the core concepts of Neural Networks like ReLU and what their combinations result into. This project is just a way to understand how the ReLU's in combination with Linear Functions make way forward for identifying all the other complex patterns. I've used INTERACT tool to understand how a change in parameters as well as the addition of multiple ReLU's totally change the structure of function and makes it more non-linear.

Sometimes, its better to come here to again see what the Deep Neural Network is doing under the hood when we get confused while implementing complex Deep Neural Network in the future endeavours.
